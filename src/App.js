  //2nd box. The movie will be fetched based on the Id we got in the array of movies. selectedId piece
  //of state will store the movie object that is selected from the list. Updating the selectedId state
  //will happen in the box on the left but the displaying of the movie happens in the 2nd Box. So both
  //boxes will need to know about the selectedId. So it definitely must live in the parent component
  //of the 2 boxes.

  //useEffect is like an event listener that is listening for one dependency to change. Whenever
  //a dependency changes, it will execute the effect again.
  //Effects are used to keep a component's state and props(dependencies) synchronized with some
  //external system that lives outside our React based code. What happens to a component whenever
  //it's state or props are updated? Component is rerendered! So Effects and component lifecycle
  //are deeply connected.
  //useEffect doesn't return anything so we don't store the result into any variable but instead
  //we pass in a function. The func is called our Effect and contains the code we want to run
  //as a side effect when the query state changes. The query state changing causes the App to rerender
  //and the side effect in the function makes API call again.  Basically what we want to register as a side effect to be executed at a
  //certain point in time. A side effect is basically any "interaction between a React component
  //and the world outside the component and make our applications do something." But they cannot
  //be contained in render logic. Instead we can create side effects in 2 different places: Inside
  //event handlers and the useEffect hook(which is triggered by rendering). useEffect allows for
  //writing code that will run at different moments in a component instance's life cycle: When
  //the component mounts, rerenders, or even when it unmounts.
